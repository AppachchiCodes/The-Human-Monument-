            I'm 29 years old. In my short time on this planet, I've seen, heard, and felt both the ugliness and the wonder of the world we live in. Every single one of us walks a path no one else can truly understand. Some lives are hard, some are joyful. Some stories are loud, others quiet. But together, we all shape the era we live in.
